# Cross-Phase Decisions

## Deferred Pipeline Work

- `04 Phase - Execute` still uses one consolidated QA-writer invocation for all features, so per-feature `eval: qa <task>` checkpoints cannot be both phase-shared and feature-local. A future phase must either move QA invocation into each feature cycle or redefine QA checkpointing as a single phase-level commit.
