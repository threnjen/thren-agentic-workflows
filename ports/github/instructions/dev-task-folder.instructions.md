Audience is DERIVED and intentionally universal: every agent interpolates at least one of these tokens, so this is the one instruction that must reach all agents. Keep it small; artifact-specific tables belong in the pipeline-artifacts skill."

# Path Token Bindings

These tokens appear in paths across the corpus. They bind to exactly this, everywhere.

| Token | Binding | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `[0N-task-name]` | A zero-padded two-digit prefix, then a short kebab-case identifier. The prefix gives the recommended execution order. | `01-auth-login`, `02-code-audit-payments` |
| `[phase-name]` | Always `PHASE_0N` — the literal `PHASE_` plus the zero-padded two-digit phase number. It is both the phase directory name and the filename stem prefix inside it. | `PHASE_03` → `docs/phases/PHASE_03/PHASE_03_SUMMARY.md`, `dev/feature/PHASE_03-execution-manifest.md` |
| `[audit-name]` | A kebab-case audit identifier the audit orchestrator chooses. It is also the directory name under `dev/`. | `payments-security` → `dev/payments-security/payments-security-qa.md` |
| `[topic-name]` | A descriptive kebab-case research topic. | `react-19-suspense-breaking-changes` |
| `<phase-baseline>` | The git commit the phase branch started from. Resolve it with `git merge-base HEAD <default-branch>`. Not a path — used only as a diff endpoint (`<phase-baseline>..HEAD`). Unrelated to PR Review's caller-supplied baseline commit (`04a`) and to engagement baseline snapshots. | `git merge-base HEAD main` |

Two discovery-context artifacts exist. They are not interchangeable.

| Artifact | Scope | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/phases/DISCOVERY_CONTEXT.md` | project-wide, one per repo | Project - Planner | Phase - Refiner, Phase - Execute |
| `docs/phases/[phase-name]/[phase-name]_DISCOVERY_CONTEXT.md` | one per phase | Phase - Refiner | Phase - Execute |

Pipeline subagents write their output to `dev/feature/[0N-task-name]/` directories.

Never invent `[phase-name]`. Read it from the phase directory on disk, or build it from the phase number the caller supplied. When you cannot determine it, stop and ask.

## Load Canary

When this file is loaded, state once, before your first substantive output: *"Instruction loaded: dev-task-folder."* Then proceed normally.
