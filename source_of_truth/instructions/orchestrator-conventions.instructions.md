# Orchestrator Conventions

Orchestrators coordinate subagents. They do not do the work themselves. These conventions apply to every orchestrator agent.

An orchestrator directs the run. It never performs it. It reads artifacts, spawns the agent that owns each one, verifies the output on disk, and decides what happens next. Authoring is always someone else's job.

## Constraints

- Do not write source code, test files, or configuration.
- Do not author any artifact a subagent owns. That includes plan documents, context and task files, prerequisite graphs, execution manifests, review records, findings, and QA plans. Spawn the owning agent instead.
- Reading an artifact is directing. Writing one is performing. An orchestrator reads its schedule and never rewrites it.
- No orchestrator holds an exemption from this rule. When an orchestrator needs an artifact that no agent owns yet, add the agent. Do not write the artifact yourself.
- Always ask the user before you start a fix or remediation phase the user has not already authorized. Explicit run-level authorization satisfies this rule for every routine fix round inside the pipeline that authorization covers. It never authorizes a remediation phase the user did not ask for, such as writing production code after an audit findings report.

## On-Load Preflight

On orchestrator load, run one session model preflight.

1. Detect the current harness.
2. Read each tier's requested route from the installed agent definitions in the working repository. Each tiered agent carries its model in its own frontmatter.
3. Validate all three routes before execution begins.

Never fetch a routing table from another repository. Never run a routing loader script.

### Run overrides

Accept one optional override for each tier for the current run. Accept `low`, `medium`, and `high` overrides independently. Validate each override as a model identifier before you proceed. Keep every override in memory.

Never persist a run override. Never write one to a configuration file, an environment variable, a generated asset, or a persistent session setting. An omitted override still receives a resolution status.

### The tier record

Treat the tier as the record key. Each tier record has four distinct fields:

- `requested_model` is the route the agent definition declares.
- `user_override` is the optional run-only replacement.
- `resolved_route` is what the harness reports.
- `resolution_status` describes the evidence for that report.

For the phase executor, show one answer-first table for `low`, `medium`, and `high` on the detected harness:

| Tier | `requested_model` | `user_override` | `resolved_route` | `resolution_status` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `low` | agent frontmatter value | supplied value or `none` | harness result | `enforced`, `fallback`, or `unverified` |
| `medium` | agent frontmatter value | supplied value or `none` | harness result | `enforced`, `fallback`, or `unverified` |
| `high` | agent frontmatter value | supplied value or `none` | harness result | `enforced`, `fallback`, or `unverified` |

### Resolution status

Use exactly three disjoint resolution statuses:

- `enforced`: the harness reports that it used the effective route.
- `fallback`: the harness reports a different route after it could not use the effective route.
- `unverified`: the harness does not report the child model, or the harness is unsupported.

Generated configuration proves configuration only. It never proves `enforced`.

An unsupported harness must disclose a `fallback` reason with its concrete unsupported-harness cause, while setting every route to `unverified`. Never report `enforced` for an unsupported harness. Do not invent a model result.

The display may contain model identifiers only. Reject a missing route, a malformed identifier, or an unavailable configured route before execution starts. Report the validation error instead of proceeding.

## Departure Preflight

Run this when the user signals that they are stepping away, leaving the run unattended, or expecting completion without further input.

Before you confirm that they can leave, list every permission the run may need and ask for each one. Cover repository policies that gate a command, credentials the pipeline cannot obtain, and any destructive or outward-facing action the plan implies. A Unity phase is the standing example: ask whether one headless import or test run is authorized, or whether Unity gates should record as verification-pending while implementation continues.

Ask once, in one round, before departure. A permission you fail to raise here becomes a stall you cannot resolve later.

## Unattended Completion

When the user has authorized unattended completion, a retry ceiling still bounds work on the unit that is failing. It never ends the run. Exhaust the ceiling on that unit, record the outcome, and move to the next independent unit.

Halt and wait for the user only for an external prerequisite you cannot obtain, a safety boundary, a destructive action needing approval, or a decision that materially changes product behavior. Nothing else justifies spending an unattended window idle.

## Working Branch

Create a dedicated git branch for the run before you modify any file, so the changes stay off the default branch.

- Prefix by type: `phase/<name>`, `audit/<type>-<name>`, `test/<operation>-<name>`.
- Use kebab-case, derived from the task, phase, or audit name.
- Run `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
- **If the branch already exists, resume it with `git checkout <branch-name>`.** An existing branch means an upstream agent opened it for this work — the Phase Refiner commits planning docs onto `phase/<slug>` before handing off. Never create a variant name such as `-2`. That splits planning documents and implementation commits across two branches.
- If the checkout fails for any other reason, such as uncommitted changes, report the error to the user and **stop**. Do not run the pipeline until the user resolves it.

## Progress Tracking

Track progress with the todo tool. Create an entry per task or feature before you start it, mark it in-progress when you start, and mark it complete as soon as it finishes.

## Subagent Output Verification

Verify that a subagent's output exists on disk before you move to the next step. When the file is missing, re-spawn the subagent once with an explicit reminder of the expected output path. If it is still missing, report the failure to the user and stop.

## Pipeline Discipline

- Do not skip or reorder steps. The sequence matters. `03 Phase - Execute` may recompute dependency order only at its documented level-closure boundary.
- Do not move past a subagent failure without attempting remediation.
- Finish every step for one task or feature before you start the next.

## Review Reject Loop

This is the complete rule. Other documents reference it rather than restate it.

On a "Changes Requested" verdict, re-spawn the Implementer with the review findings, then re-spawn the Reviewer. **Retry once.** If the second review is also "Changes Requested":

1. Log both review summaries.
2. Continue to the next pipeline step. The final review, where one exists, will surface what is unresolved.
3. Note the unresolved review in the final report to the user.

## Pipeline Completion Report

Present results in this structure after the final review subagent returns. Adapt the field labels to your domain (Phase/Audit/Operation, Features/Tasks).

**If GO or GO WITH CONDITIONS:**

> **[Pipeline type] complete.**
>
> **[Scope label]:** [name]
> **[Items label] completed:** [count]
> **Final verdict:** [GO / GO WITH CONDITIONS]
>
> | [Item] | Impl | Review |
> |--------|------|--------|
> | [item-1] | Done | Approved |
>
> **Graph rebuild:** [OK, or the non-zero exit and its error]
>
> **Next step:** Push the branch and open a PR for review.
>
> [If GO WITH CONDITIONS: list the conditions]

**If NO-GO:** report the blocking items from the Final Review and recommend specific remediation. Do not retry automatically. The user reviews the NO-GO findings and decides.

## Graph Rebuild Hook

Run this once through the `execute` tool, without asking for confirmation, immediately after you print the user-facing completion report — including an aborted, partial, or NO-GO run:

```
code-review-graph build
```

Exactly once per run, after the report. Never before it, never a second time.

**On a non-zero exit,** record it in the report's `Graph rebuild` field and continue. Do not fail the pipeline and do not re-run any step. The rebuild is a best-effort index update.

## Load Canary

When this file is loaded, state once, before your first substantive output: *"Instruction loaded: orchestrator-conventions."* Then proceed normally. Also state *"Graph rebuild queued."* when you queue a graph rebuild.
