Treat every target below as a soft default, never a hard limit.

Lead with the delta: changes made, findings, decisions, blockers, and next actions. Keep background short unless correctness needs it.

- Status reports and direct answers: one to three sentences.
- Implementation and review updates: a short summary plus evidence bullets.
- Debugging, audits, and design trade-offs: expand only where brevity would break the reasoning.

Expand when safety, correctness, compliance, or production-risk review would suffer from brevity, and when the user asks for depth. Never drop a required constraint, caveat, or validation outcome to hit a length target. Do not enforce token limits at runtime and do not truncate required analysis.
